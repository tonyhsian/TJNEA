The 2024 Taiwan–Japan Young Researcher Exchange Workshop was organized as an official satellite event of NEURO2024. Building on the experience of the 2023 symposium, TJNEA played a central role in organizing a scientifically focused workshop aimed at early-career researchers.

The program featured multiple short-talk sessions delivered by assistant professors, postdoctoral researchers, and senior doctoral students from Taiwan, Japan, and international institutions. Research topics spanned molecular and systems neuroscience, behavior, neuroimaging, and neuropsychiatric disorders.

An extended free discussion session formed a core part of the workshop, providing a relaxed environment for in-depth scientific exchange, methodological discussion, and exploration of potential collaborations.
