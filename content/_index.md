        <h2> Welcome to the Taiwan–Japan Neuroscience Exchange Association (TJNEA)</h2>
        <p>
        The Taiwan–Japan Neuroscience Exchange Association (TJNEA) is a community-driven initiative dedicated to fostering academic exchange and collaboration between neuroscience researchers in Taiwan and Japan. Our mission is to create an open, inclusive, and sustainable platform where ideas, techniques, and collaborations can grow beyond institutional and national boundaries.
        </p>
        <p>
        Since 2023, TJNEA has organized a series of scientific and social exchange events alongside major neuroscience meetings, including the Annual Meeting of the Japan Neuroscience Society (JNS). These events bring together principal investigators, early-career researchers, postdoctoral fellows, and students across diverse subfields of neuroscience.
        </p>
        <p>
        We place particular emphasis on young researchers, believing that early international exposure and peer-level interaction are essential for building long-term scientific networks. Through short talks, panel-style sessions, and extended free discussions, TJNEA aims to lower the barriers to collaboration and encourage candid scientific dialogue.
        </p>
        <p>
        Looking forward, TJNEA seeks to expand its role as a hub for Taiwan–Japan neuroscience collaboration by continuously refining our events, broadening participation, and supporting new cross-border research connections.
